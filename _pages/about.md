Hi! 👋 I study Computer Science and Robotics at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu) in the [Turing Scholars](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/turing-scholars-honors-program) honors program. Advised by [Dr. Amy Pavel](https://amypavel.com), I am working on making complex physical skill learning (_i.e.,_ [dance](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2511.09658)) accessible for blind and low-vision individuals. I also collaborated on an accessible [AI-powered task assistant](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.00717) to support physical tasks such as cooking and crafting. Please see the [Publications](https://ujjainidas.github.io/publications/) tab for more information!

I am broadly excited about making learning and creativity accessible through personalized and adaptive tools. I use community-centered approaches such as [co-design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09658) and user-informed [system development and evaluation](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.00717) to amplify the voices of people underserved by technology.

I have also completed three internships at [Apple](https://www.apple.com), where I worked on features for [Apple Intelligence](https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/) and [iOS UI/UX](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2025/06/19/use-3d-wallpaper-iphone/). I am currently an engineer building camera software for [visionOS](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/), iOS, and macOS releases. 

Beyond research, I enjoy dancing 💃, rock climbing 🧗‍♀️, and reading 📖. Please feel free to connect with me at [ujjaini@utexas.edu](mailto:ujjaini@utexas.edu)!
